# Virginia Trails & Breweries 🍺🏞️🚴

Virginia Trails & Breweries is a personal project highlighting hiking trails, biking routes, and craft breweries across the Commonwealth, combining outdoor adventure with Virginia’s deep-rooted beer culture.

## 📖 About Us
Virginia offers hundreds of miles of trails for hiking and biking, including more than 550 miles of the Appalachian Trail alone, plus countless local and regional paths spanning forests, parks, and scenic byways throughout the state.

Beyond the trails, the Commonwealth boasts well over 100 breweries, making it a vibrant beer and cider destination where visitors can unwind after a day outdoors. Beer has deep roots here — from early colonial brews in the 1600s to a booming modern craft beer scene that celebrates centuries of brewing tradition and tasting room culture.

Come with us and explore the beauty and crisp cold beers!
