# Virginia Trails & Breweries 🍺🏞️🚴

Virginia Trails & Breweries is a personal web project built on a custom HTML5 UP template, designed to showcase hiking trails, biking routes, and craft breweries across the Commonwealth of Virginia. The site blends outdoor adventure with Virginia’s deep-rooted beer culture in a clean, responsive layout.

## 🌄 About the Project
Virginia offers hundreds of miles of trails for hiking and biking, including more than 550 miles of the Appalachian Trail alone, plus countless local and regional paths spanning forests, parks, and scenic byways throughout the state.

Beyond the trails, the Commonwealth boasts well over 100 breweries, making it a vibrant beer and cider destination where visitors can unwind after a day outdoors. Beer has deep roots here — from early colonial brews in the 1600s to a booming modern craft beer scene that celebrates centuries of brewing tradition and tasting room culture.

Come explore the beauty of Virginia and enjoy crisp, cold beers along the way.
